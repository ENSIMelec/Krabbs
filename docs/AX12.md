# AX-12A

We are currently using AX-12A (or AX-12+) from Robotis. You can find all the documentation on their website if needed.

## Specifications

- Input Voltage : 9.0 ~ 12.0V (Recommended : 11.1V)
- Current : 1.5 A
- Baud rate : 1000000
- Protocol version : 1.0

## Recomandations 

Before doing anything, you will need to find the ids of each motors. To do so, use the wizard from Dynamixel. 
You can download it [here](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/dynamixel/dynamixel_wizard2/).


In the options, select all COM ports. Deselect all the baud rates except for 1000000.
Then, click on `Scan` to find all the connected motors.
Tadam ! You can test if they work and see their ids.


**Important :**
When you are programming, make sure to enable torque at start before doing anything. Once you are finished, make sure to disable the torque once again.
Don't forget to close the port at the end of the program.

[Here](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/dynamixel/dynamixel_sdk/sample_code/cpp_read_write_protocol_1_0/#cpp-protocol-10) is a sample code to let you start from scratch if needed.

## Installing Dynamixel SDK

AX-12 are programmable using the Dynamixel SDK. 
You can find the documentation [here](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/dynamixel/dynamixel_sdk/overview/).
To install the SDK on the Raspberries, follow these steps :

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/DynamixelSDK.git
$ cd DynamixelSDK/cpp/build/linux_sbc
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

If you are using CMake, make sure to link the sdk : 
```
# In case this is not already added
link_directories(/usr/include)

# Link dxl sdk
target_link_libraries(krabbs dxl_sbc_cpp)
```

If you need more depth informations about the installation, you can follow the [official tutorial](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/dynamixel/dynamixel_sdk/library_setup/cpp_linux/#cpp-linux).
